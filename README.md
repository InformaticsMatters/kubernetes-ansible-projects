# kubernetes-ansible-projects

A repository with a Visual-Studio code [devcontainer] that is designed to simplify the
development and execution of our various kubernetes-based ansible projects. Each
of our relevant ansible projects is automatically included in this repository as
a Git [submodule] allowing us to keep our ansible repositories as a subdirectory
of this Git repository, and keep their commits separate.
