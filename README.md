# kubernetes-ansible-projects

A repository with a Visual-Studio code [devcontainer]. This exists to simplify the
development and execution of our various kubernetes-based ansible projects by
providing a consistent environment for playbook execution. Ansible projects
are automatically included in this repository using the Git [submodule], making
each ansible repository a subdirectory of this repository, but keeping their
commits separate.
